# blogspot

Compiles a blogspot blog into a standalone html file and PDF.

Currently (as far as I'm aware) it only works for blogger/blogspot sites with the Contempo theme and an index page.

## Usage

```bash
python3 blogspot_fetch.py <blog_index_url>
```

E.g.

```bash
python3 blogspot_fetch https://myblog.blogspot.com/p/index.html
```
